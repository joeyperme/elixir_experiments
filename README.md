# elixir_experiments

This repository houses experiments with the Elixir language.  
Elixir is a primarily functional but multi-paradigm message-passing language that runs 
on BEAM (Erlang virtual machine).  

Many of the .ex files here are from exercises from [this](https://elixirschool.com/en/) 
introductory series to Elixir.
